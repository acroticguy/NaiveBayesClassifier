**NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFIER**

For the 2nd assignment of my course on Artificial Intelligence, I had to create a Naive Bayes Classifier from scratch, then compare it with the classifier from scikit-learn, and a MLP from Tensorflow (Keras). 

The purpose of the model is to read a movie review, and guess whether the review is positive or negative. The IMDB dataset was used as training material.
